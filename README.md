## 🔍 **Data Analysis Overview**

In this section, we break down the queries used to analyze different aspects of the bike store's business operations.

### 📊 **Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis**
- **Objective**: Understand customer purchase patterns by frequency and total spend.
- **Key Metrics**: Total spend, order count, recency of last purchase, customer segmentation based on activity status.
- **Findings**: Customers were categorized into *Active*, *Lapsing*, *At Risk*, and *Lost* based on their purchase recency.

### 🏷️ **Product Performance Across Stores**
- **Objective**: Assess product performance across different stores and evaluate stock levels.
- **Key Metrics**: Units sold, total revenue, average selling price, inventory status.
- **Findings**: Products are ranked by sales performance, and inventory is classified as *Out of Stock*, *Low Stock*, *Adequate Stock*, or *Overstocked*.

### 📈 **Monthly Sales Trends with YoY Comparison**
- **Objective**: Analyze monthly sales trends and compare year-over-year (YoY) performance.
- **Key Metrics**: Monthly sales, units sold, order count, YoY growth percentage.
- **Findings**: A YoY comparison highlights growth trends, with a running total and rolling 12-month average to track overall performance.

### 🛠️ **Staff Performance Analysis**
- **Objective**: Evaluate the performance of staff members and compare them to their peers.
- **Key Metrics**: Total sales, order count, sales per staff member, ranking within the store.
- **Findings**: Staff performance is categorized as *Top Performer*, *Above Average*, *Average*, and *Below Average*.

### 🌍 **Sales by Geographic Region**
- **Objective**: Analyze sales performance by geographic region and assess market penetration.
- **Key Metrics**: Total customers, total sales, sales per customer, customers per 100k population.
- **Findings**: Market penetration is determined for each city, highlighting areas with high customer density.

### 💰 **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis**
- **Objective**: Estimate the lifetime value of each customer to predict long-term business revenue.
- **Key Metrics**: Total spend, order count, customer span, projected 3-year CLV.
- **Findings**: Customers are segmented into value groups, with top spenders identified for targeted marketing.

### 💡 **Order Fulfillment Timing Analysis**
- **Objective**: Analyze the time it takes to fulfill orders, from order date to shipping.
- **Key Metrics**: Average days to ship, days until required, early or late deliveries.
- **Findings**: Averages are computed across various order statuses to identify efficiency gaps in the fulfillment process.

### 🔎 **Product Availability Across Stores**
- **Objective**: Track product availability across all stores to ensure products are well-stocked.
- **Key Metrics**: Number of stores with stock, total inventory, percentage of stores carrying each product.
- **Findings**: A detailed inventory status report indicates how well each product is stocked across the network.

## 📊 **Key Findings & Results**

- **Customer Segmentation**: Customers were successfully segmented based on purchase recency, helping to target marketing efforts to *Active* and *Lapsing* customers.
- **Product Stocking**: A large proportion of products were found to have adequate stock, though there were a few that were identified as being *Out of Stock* or *Low Stock* in certain locations.
- **Sales Trends**: The analysis revealed a steady growth in sales with some seasonal fluctuations, providing insights for future stock and marketing strategies.
- **Staff Performance**: Top-performing staff were identified, with some stores outperforming others in sales figures, suggesting potential for staff training and resource allocation.
